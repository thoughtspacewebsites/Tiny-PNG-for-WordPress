#Tiny PNG for WordPress
---------------------------

Tiny PNG for WordPress is a plugin that automatically runs any PNGs uploaded to the WordPress admin interface through the Tiny PNG service for large image compression rates (up to 70%!). This plugin will drastically reduce your page load times.

##Installation
--------------------------

This plugin is a "set up and leave it" plugin that only requires a small amount of initial setup. First, download the plugin from this repo by using the "Download ZIP" button to the right. Once you've got the plugin ZIP, simply log in to your WordPress admin panel, hover over plugins, and click add new. At the top of the next screen, you should see an upload link. Click this, and then click the button to select the plugin. After that, simply click upload, and on the next page click activate. Your plugin is now installed.

##Setup
-------------------------

After you've installed the plugin, you still have a bit of setup. First, you'll have to visit https://tinypng.com/developers and sign up for an API key using your full name and email. There is a free API key that offers 500 conversions per month. Once you've signed up for an API key, you'll need to find it and copy it to your clipboard.
After you've got the API key copied to your clipboard, simply log in to your WordPress admin panel, hover over "Settings" on the left hand side, and click "Tiny PNG for WordPress". On the next page, you'll see a field where you can insert your API key. Simply place it in there and click the update button to save it.

##Running the plugin
------------------------

After activating the plugin and inserting your API key, any PNG that is uploaded to your WordPress site will automatically be run through TinyPNG before being run through the WordPress image crunching system. Please note that any PNGs that have already been uploaded will not be optimized, only freshly uploaded images. This is planned for a future release.
